IDEAS BITCH

1) Create an input for the bracket for teams to add song/songs
   to a playlist that plays during the tournament.

2) Add a dropdown to the navbar for "Gallery" so people can
   select which year of pictures they want to cycle through.

3) (#1 priority) NEEDS to be mobile friendly. We should probably address this sooner rather than later as it will become more difficult.

4) Lightbox for gallery images when clicked 

5) Probably don't need a socials tab, could put that information in the global footer.

6) polling system for best dressed

7) images in gallery are hardcoded, will eventually have to go to an automatic solution to load images. (lazy loading?)
