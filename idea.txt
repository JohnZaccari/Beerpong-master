IDEAS BITCH

1) Create an input for the bracket for teams to add song/songs
   to a playlist that plays during the tournament.

2) Add a dropdown to the navbar for "Gallery" so people can
   select which year of pictures they want to cycle through.

3) (#1 priority) NEEDS to be mobile friendly. We should probably address this sooner rather than later as it will become more difficult.

4) Lightbox for gallery images when clicked

5) Add global footer socials

6) polling system for best dressed

7) images in gallery are hardcoded, will eventually have to go to an automatic solution to load images. (lazy loading?)

8) beer pong image always link to home page

9) add "Bod" and "about" to nav bar

10)real time bracket update when a team signs up (use array check to see if spot already assigned);

11) global footer location, screenshot

12) WSOBP style footer
